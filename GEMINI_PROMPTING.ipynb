    "# Day 1 - Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n",
    "* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n",
    "* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers."

The garden was a jungle, teeming with vibrant flora and curious creatures: a grumpy robin, a haughty squirrel, and a fat, waddling hedgehog who snorted at Barnaby's audacity.\n",

He scaled a rickety trellis, navigated a thicket of thorny roses, and even faced a grumpy, barking dog (who, surprisingly, seemed more interested in chasing butterflies). Finally, he reached the end of the garden – a shimmering, blue pond, whispered to be the home of the Rainbow Trout.\n",

Barnaby, with the agility of a seasoned hunter, launched himself into the pond, water splashing around him. But the trout was too fast, too clever. He darted away, leaving Barnaby sputtering and soaked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disheartened but not defeated, Barnaby climbed back onto the bank. He sat there, watching the setting sun paint the sky in hues of orange and purple. He realized the journey, the thrill of the chase, was just as rewarding as the catch. He wasn't just a house cat, he was a traveler, an explorer. He had faced his fears, conquered challenges, and seen a world beyond the comfort of his sunbeam.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he crept back inside, his fur damp but his heart full, Barnaby knew this was just the beginning. He had tasted adventure, and he wouldn't settle for anything less. And who knows, maybe the next time, the Rainbow Trout would be his. \n",

       "- **Loads colors and themes:** It defines functions to load color schemes and themes from files. You can customize these to change the appearance of the prompt.\n",
       "- **Fetches remote status:**  It periodically checks for updates on the remote repository, fetching changes if your local copy is outdated.\n",
       "- **Calculates Git status:** It runs Git commands to determine the current branch, changes staged, unstaged changes, and other relevant information.\n",
       "- **Formats the prompt:** It constructs a custom prompt string that includes the Git status information, alongside other settings like your virtual environment.\n",
       "- **Installs itself:** It adds the necessary commands to your `PROMPT_COMMAND` to ensure that the Git prompt is updated whenever a new command is executed.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why you would use it:**\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Enhanced information:** Instead of just showing your current directory, it provides information like the current Git branch, upstream changes, and file status, making it easier to understand your Git context.\n",
       "- **Visual clarity:** It adds colors and symbols to visually differentiate different Git states, such as changed files, staged changes, or conflicts.\n",
       "- **Improved workflow:** By displaying this information directly in your prompt, you can quickly assess the state of your Git repository without needing to run separate Git commands. \n",
       "\n",
       "**In essence, this script automates the process of displaying relevant Git information within your terminal prompt, making your Git workflow more efficient and intuitive.**\n"
